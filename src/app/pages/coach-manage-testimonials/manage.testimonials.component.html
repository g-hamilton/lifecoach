        centre. Lifecoach helps you to capture new client testimonials by prompting clients at 
        the optimum point in their coaching journey. If you don't yet have client history on the 
        platform, you can upload a few of your best testimonials to give people a better idea of your 
        coaching style. After capturing a few tistimonials here, you can decide which ones to 
        showcase on your coach profile page and occasionally, we showcase our favourite 
        testimonials on the Lifecoach home page.
