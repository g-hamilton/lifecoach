                  Why make a self-study course?
                </strong>
                <p>
                  Self-study is a great way to offer a little bit of yourself and your specialist knowledge to a very large number
                  of students at a lower cost and in a way that allows students to learn on their own schedule. This lowers the 
                  barrier to entry and provides an excellent opportunity to build rapport with your students before leading them into
                  longer term 1:1 coaching.
